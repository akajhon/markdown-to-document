Lumma Stealer - Cyber Threat Intelligence Report

# Introduction

::: {.indented}
The Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team is responsible for monitoring emerging and persistent threats to protect brand integrity and prevent the exposure of sensitive information. This proactive monitoring aims to identify prevalent malware campaigns, new Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and threat actor activities that may affect the organization, its employees, or its partners. This report focuses on the Lumma Stealer, a significant information-stealing malware.
:::

# Executive Summary

::: {.indented}
Lumma Stealer (also known as LummaC2) is a prominent information-stealing malware operating on a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model, making it accessible to a wide range of financially motivated threat actors. Developed by an actor known as "Shamel," Lumma Stealer poses a significant threat by exfiltrating sensitive data from compromised Windows systems. Its distribution is opportunistic and relies heavily on sophisticated social engineering, malvertising, and abuse of trusted platforms, making it a persistent risk to organizations across all sectors.
:::

# Threat Details

::: {.indented}
The primary function of Lumma Stealer is to harvest and exfiltrate a wide variety of sensitive data from victim machines. The malware is written in C and is continuously updated with advanced features to evade detection and maximize data theft. Its MaaS model allows affiliates to customize and deploy the malware easily. The primary types of data targeted include:
:::

- Browser Credentials: Usernames, passwords, cookies, and autofill data from over 10 major web browsers.
- Cryptocurrency Wallets: Data from numerous cryptocurrency wallet applications and browser extensions.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Tokens: Information from 2FA extensions, potentially allowing attackers to bypass multi-factor authentication.
- System Information: Detailed information about the compromised machine, including hardware, OS version, and IP address.
- Application Data: Credentials and data from various applications, including FTP clients and messaging apps like Telegram.

::: {.indented}
The malware employs a multi-stage, often fileless, execution chain using obfuscated PowerShell scripts and Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLBINs) like mshta.exe to evade detection. A particularly effective delivery method is the "ClickFix" technique, where victims are tricked by fake CAPTCHA pages into pasting and executing malicious commands in the Windows Run dialog, bypassing browser-based security controls. Data is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a resilient and frequently changing Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.
:::

# Threat Actor Profile

::: {.indented}
The threat actor "Shamel" (also known as "Lumma") is a Russian-speaking developer responsible for creating and maintaining the Lumma Stealer. The malware has been advertised on Russian-language underground forums since August 2022. Shamel operates a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) business, selling subscriptions to the stealer via Telegram and a dedicated website. This model allows a broad range of cybercriminals, from low-skilled individuals to sophisticated groups like the ransomware operator Octo Tempest, to use the malware for initial access and data theft. Subscription tiers range from approximately $250 per month to $20,000 for access to the source code, making it a commercially successful and widely distributed threat.

# Mitigation Recommendations

1. **User Awareness Training**: Educate employees to recognize phishing, malvertising, and social engineering tactics like the "ClickFix" fake CAPTCHA. Emphasize caution against downloading software from untrusted sources or executing commands from websites.
2. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Deploy and configure an EDR solution to monitor for anomalous process behavior, such as mshta.exe spawning PowerShell, or unauthorized processes accessing browser credential stores.
3. **Restrict Script Execution**: Use application control policies to restrict the execution of PowerShell and other scripting languages for users who do not require them for their job functions.
4. **Network Filtering**: Block connections to known malicious domains and newly registered domains (NRDs), which are frequently used for C2 infrastructure. Use DNS filtering and web gateways to prevent access to malware distribution sites.
5. **Credential Hygiene**: Encourage the use of password managers instead of saving credentials in browsers. Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical services to mitigate the impact of stolen credentials.
6. **Regular Software Updates**: Keep operating systems, browsers, and other software patched and up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities that could be exploited in multi-stage attacks.

# Conclusion

The Lumma Stealer represents a mature and resilient threat within the cybercrime ecosystem, amplified by its accessible MaaS model. Its reliance on sophisticated social engineering and evasive execution techniques makes it a danger that bypasses traditional signature-based defenses. Organizations must adopt a multi-layered security posture that combines advanced technical controls with robust user education to effectively mitigate the risk of credential theft and subsequent network compromise.
